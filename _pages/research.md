<br/>

**Abstract**:   This paper aims to elaborate a treated data set and apply the boosting methodology to monthly Brazilian macroeconomic variables to check its predictability. The forecasting performed here consists in using linear and nonlinear base-learners, as well as a third type of model that has both linear and nonlinear components in the estimation of the variables using the history itself with lag up to 12 periods. The results obtained here through different evaluation approaches point out that, on average, the performance of boosting models using P-Splines as base-learner are the ones that have the best results, especially the methodology with two components: two-stage boosting. Finally, we perform alternative methods to check the robustness of the results.

**Abstract**: This paper seeks to test the component-wise boosting validity as an instrument of forecasting regional series in economic recessions. We use 822 predictors to forecast the monthly electricity consumption of the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul. The time series has 190 observations and occurs during the 2015 political and economic crisis of Brazil, the biggest economic crisis in the countryâ€™s history until then, which significantly impacted the electricity consumption behavior. Using 12 lags of the predictors, boosting manages to select predictors associated with the crisis and is capable of understanding better the trend change compared to a standard seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) benchmark. We found three selected predictor clusters: lags of Y, which model the seasonality of the series, the lagged electricity consumption around Brazil, which serve to update the model the recent changes in the electricity consumption, and the unemployment rates, which are directly related to the crisis. We conclude the paper bringing two alternative exercises, using k-fold in the place of AICc and also executing a quantile-boosting exercise. By filtering a high-dimensional data set, the machine learning algorithm appears as a useful instrument when forecasting short regional series within recessions.

## Works in Progress

### Analyzing the Effect of the German 9 Euro Ticket on Hotel Pricing

**Work**:   This project aims to analyze the effect of the 9 Euro ticket on hotel pricing in Germany. The 9 Euro ticket is a (monthly) low-cost public-transport ticket that was offered in Germany from June 2022 to August 2022. The goal of this project is to investigate the effect of the 9 Euro ticket on hotel pricing---in particular whether there was increased competition between hotels in and further away the city center.
