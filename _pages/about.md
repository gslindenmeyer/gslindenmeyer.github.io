I am a Master of Economics student at the **University of Mannheim** and currently a RA to Prof. Lei Li at the University of Mannheim.

### Research and Projects

During my bachelor's degree I did a research fellowship where, together with my friend Pedro Skorin and Prof. Hudson Torrent, we published our **first paper** together.
